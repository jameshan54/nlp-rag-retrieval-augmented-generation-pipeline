## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

This project implements a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline by retrieving the most relevant documents for each query and using an LLM (via vLLM) to generate the final answer. It includes similarity-based retrieval, prompt tuning, validation accuracy tracking, and test inference generation.
